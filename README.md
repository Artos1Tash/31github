This is a repository of a challenge that I'm participating in [#31github](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzRBtg0IDyx/) [#ghlchallenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzRBtg0IDyx/)
that was organized by <strong> @growthhungry </strong> and <strong> @dtaalai </strong>
--------------------------------
In this project I'll create a simple modern blog application with React.js, Next.js, GraphQL, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

I'll be following this online [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=986hztrfaSQ) during 31 days.

## Journal
Day 1 : I started the video tutorial. Feeling pretty good
<br/>
Day 2 : This day I copied a lot of template code into common.types.ts and tailwind.config.ts 
<br/>
Also solved some of the rendering home page problems.
<br/>
Day 4:
Feeling pretty good. Just a bit tired. Started understanding Tailwind CSS, which is actually very easy library. I actually skipped journal for day 3.
<br/>
Day 5-8:
First problem. I cannot understand why the grafbase doesn't want to deploy my project. Struggling. A lot of stuff coming up this week.
<br/>
Day 9:
Today, I couldn't make the button appear on the screen. I think the problem is because it doesn't know where the folder is, but I'm not sure. A lot of projects are coming soon. I need some rest
<br/>
Day 10:
It was a very intensive day. Test, projects and I finally took some rest. I did some programming today, and I want to create AI.
<br/>
Day 11:
Project is going difficult. I'll wait 'til I solve some grafbase problems here and then push the better version on github. The week is almost over.
<br/>
Day: 12
I didn't do much coding today, but I did the presentations, which went very well. Math is so hard rn.
<br/>
Day: 13
Did a little bit of coding today. Got a new mechanical keyboard. It's even harder to type rn.
<br/>
Day: 14
It's been 2 weeks since I started this tutorial. It's going pretty hard, but I don't lose hope.
<br/>
Day 15: 
It's snowing outside. I almost finished the book Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.
Project is going strange, but I need to continue.
<br/>
Day 16: 
There are more snow currently. Getting better at typing. I don't have much time for everything, it's getting harder.

<br/>
Day 17:
I started CS50 course on Python with my friend. Also asked for the help in this current project.
<br/>
Day 18:
Couldn't understand why button google doens't show up on the main page in Navbar file. Interesting.
<br/>
Day 19:
Ooh, so tired. Soon there's going to be a financial literacy competition. I started preparing fot it. Takes time, but it's more important right now in this situation.
<br/>
Day 20:
Training, swimming pool and chores. Planning to go to live music today. Preparing myself for competition.
