# @31github

This is a repository of a challenge that I'm participating in [#31github](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzRBtg0IDyx/) [#ghlchallenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzRBtg0IDyx/)
that was organized by <strong> @growthhungry </strong> and <strong> @dtaalai </strong>
--------------------------------
In this project I'll create a simple modern blog application with React.js, Next.js, GraphQL, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

I'll be following this online [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=986hztrfaSQ) during 31 days.
